# PerceptronPytorch
Simple Perceptron in Pytorch. Fairly vanilla. This is a good starting place for people interested in learning deep learning.
Keep in mind this is a very old and inefficient way of training. It only works well if there is a very distinct boundary between two groups 
of datapoints.
